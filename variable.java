//It is a variable which belongs to the class and not to object(instance)
//Static variables are initialized only once, at the start of the execution. These variables will be initialized first, before the initialization of any instance variables
//A single copy to be shared by all instances of the class
//A static variable can be accessed directly by the class name and doesnâ€™t need any object
